# Battery Results

* The first batch of batteries, [_Duracell Plus Power Alkaline AA_](storage-duracel-plus-power-aa-1.csv) lasted 3.85 weeks (27 days)
* The second batch of batteries [_Duracell Plus Power Alkaline AA_](storage-duracel-plus-power-aa-2.csv) lasted 5.84 weeks (40 days)
* The third batch of batteries [_Duracell Plus Power Alkaline AA_](storage-duracel-plus-power-aa-3.csv) lasted 4.28 weeks (30 days); this is weird because I switched the mouse off over nights and weekends!
* The fourth batch of batteries [_Duracell Plus Power Alkaline AA_](storage-duracel-plus-power-aa-4.csv) lasted 6.85 weeks (48 days); the mouse is still switched off over nights and weekends.
* The fifth batch of batteries [_Industrial by Duracell, Alkaline AA_](storage-industrial-by-duracell-aa-1.csv) lasted for 5.43 weeks(38 days); the mouse is still switched off over nights and weekends.
* The sixth batch of batteries [_Industrial by Duracell, Alkaline AA_](storage-industrial-by-duracell-aa-2.csv) lasted for 3.60 weeks(25 days); the mouse is still switched off over nights and weekends.
* The seventh batch of batteries [_Industrial by Duracell, Alkaline AA_](storage-industrial-by-duracell-aa-3.csv) lasted for 5.31 weeks(37 days); the mouse is still switched off over nights and weekends.
* The eighth batch of batteries [_Duracell Ultra Power Alkaline AA_](storage-duracel-ultra-power-aa-1.csv) lasted 5.26 weeks (36.84 days); the mouse was left on continuously.
* The ninth batch of batteries [_Energizer Industrial, Pile Alkaline AA_](storage-energizer-industrial-aa-1.csv) ran down from 84% to 0% over four weeks without my mac switched on while the mouse was switched on. This energy draw is unexpected as the mouse wasn't in use and one would expect it to have gone into hibernation until awoken.
* The tenth batch of batteries [_Duracell Ultra Power, Duralock. Alkaline AA](storage-duracell-ultra-power-duralock.csv) lasted 5.14 weeks. The mouse was largely left on and very occasionally switched off for transportation while working from home.
* The eleventh batch of batteries [_Duracell Plus Power Alkaline AA_](storage-duracell-plus-power-aa-5.csv) lasted 4.39 weeks (30 days). The mouse was largely left on and very occasionally switched off for transportation while working from home.
* The twelfth batch of batteries [GP Ultra, Alkaline AA](storage-gp-ultra-alkaline-aa-1.csv) lasted 4.98 weeks (34 days.) The mouse was largely left switched on.
* The thirteenth batch of batteries [GP Ultra, Alkaline AA](storage-gp-ultra-alkaline-aa-2.csv) lasted 6.02 weeks (42 days.) It was left switched off for just over one week over Christmas.
* The fourteenth batch of batteries [GP Ultra, Alkaline AA](storage-gp-ultra-alkaline-aa-3.csv) lasted 3.32 weeks (23 days.) The mouse was largely left switched on and got a _lot_ of use.
* The fifteenth batch of batteries [Duracell Ultra, Alkaline AA](storage-duracell-ultra-alkaline-aa-1.csv) lasted 3.91 weeks (27 days.) The mouse was only really switched off at night and got a _lot_ of use.
* The sixteenth batch of batteries [Ikea Alkalisk, Alkaline AA](storage-ikea-alkalisk-aa-1.csv) lasted 5.21 weeks (36.49 days.) The mouse was in heavy use for 8+ hours of the day and switched off at night.
* The seventeenth batch of batteries [Ikea Alkalisk, Alkaline AA](storage-ikea-alkalisk-aa-2.csv) lasted 6.22 weeks (43.53 days.) The mouse was in use throughout the day for 8+ hours and not often switched off.
* The eighteenth batch of batteries [Ikea Alkalisk, Alkaline AA](storage-ikea-alkalisk-aa-3.csv) lasted 4.92 weeks (34.45 days.) The mouse was in use for about 10-15 hours a day.
* The nineteenth batch of batteries [Ikea Alkalisk, Alkaline AA](storage-ikea-alkalisk-aa-4.csv) lasted 3.20 weeks (22.44 days.) The mouse was in use for about 15-20 hours a day.
